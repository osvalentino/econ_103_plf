As a Peer Learning Facilitator for ECON 103 (Econometrics) — widely regarded as the most challenging course for final-year economics students at UCLA — through UCLA’s Academic Advancement Program (AAP), I provided academic support to groups of students by fostering critical thinking, intellectual independence, and collaborative learning. I facilitated peer learning sessions that emphasized active engagement with course material, guiding students through complex econometric concepts and encouraging analytical dialogue to strengthen their understanding.  My role included offering constructive feedback, empowering students to develop their problem-solving skills, and serving as an academic role model.

I tutored R and Python, equipping students with the technical skills needed for their data-driven projects, and developed custom worksheets on theoretical mathematics and statistics to reinforce foundational concepts, such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and statistical interpretation. Here I showcase some of the worksheets I have compiled for my peers in ECON 103.
