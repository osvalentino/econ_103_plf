# Nonlinear Relationships 

### Polynomial

$$
Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1X +  \beta_2X^2
$$
$$
\frac{\partial E[Y|X]}{\partial X}|_{X=x}=\beta_1 + 2\beta_2x
$$


### Log

### Interaction

$$
Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 +  \beta_2X_2 + \beta_3 (X_1 \times X_2)
$$
$$
\frac{\partial E[Y|X_1, X_2]}{\partial X_1}|_{X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2}=\beta_1 + \beta_3x_2
$$

# Example

$$
\text{wage} = 10 + \text{exp} + 2\text{exp}^2 + 3\text{male} + 4(\text{exp}\times\text{male}) + 5\log(\text{edu})
$$
